<h1>Crafty <i>(like a Fox)</i> Writing Tool</h1>

Learning is mimicry, and this was my first non-tutorial project! 

I wanted to know how the writing tools of my college days worked, so I create my own rewards-based word counter. This project is just Javascript, HTML, and CSS. 
For every 100, 300, or 500 words you write, you are rewarded with a new random picture of a fox, thanks to <a href="https://randomfox.ca/"> RandomFox </a>.  

I kept the CSS pretty simple, so I want to go back and make the design more interesting. I also intend to add other kinds of motivators -- possible add a joke API, or for those who don't like positive encouragement I think I can do Shakespearean insults. If you see me updating the code for this project, that's why.
